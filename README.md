# Personalised Prediction of PTSD from Speech

This project explores personalised PTSD prediction from speech signals using features extracted via **Wav2Vec2.0** and **eGeMAPS**, followed by classification with **SVM**, **XGBoost**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Trees**.

> Conducted as part of the Computational Intelligence Seminar at the University of Augsburg in 2023.
